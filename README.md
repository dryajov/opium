## Opium ##

`Opium` is a dependency injection framework for javascript. The aim of `opium` is to provide the simplest possible and yet functionally complete dependency injection solution.  

`Opium`'s main feature is its lack of assumptions around dependency declaration techniques; such as XML, JSON or a DSL. Instead, opium relies on a clean and non opinionated api, that leaves the door open to use you're own style/technique for declaring dependencies.
